# ProfileImageUpload - Updated Implementation

## ✅ Successfully Migrated to Shared Media Upload System

### Overview
The `ProfileImageUpload` component has been updated to use the established shared media upload system, following the same patterns as the `UploadMedia` component.

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. **Removed Custom Implementation**
- Deleted `apps/web/app/featured/profile/clients/file.client.ts` 
- Deleted `apps/web/app/featured/profile/hooks/use-file-upload.hooks.ts`
- Now uses shared system from `@/app/shared/`

#### 2. **Updated to Use Shared Hooks & Utilities**
```tsx
// Before (custom implementation)
import { useMediaUploadMutation } from "../../hooks/use-file-upload.hooks";

// After (shared system)
import { getMediaId, useMediaUpload } from "@/app/shared/hooks/use-media-upload";
```

#### 3. **Consistent Upload Pattern**
```tsx
// Upload media using shared hook
const result = await uploadMedia.mutateAsync({
    file,
    alt_text: `Profile image for ${user?.name || "user"}`,
    description: "User profile picture",
});

// Extract media ID using shared utility
const mediaId = getMediaId(result);

// Update profile with new image ID
await patchProfileMutation.mutateAsync({
    profile_image_id: mediaId,
});
```

#### 4. **Proper Image Display**
```tsx
// Uses the established pattern with NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL
<AvatarImage
    src={
        previewUrl ||
        (user?.media_object?.file_path ? 
            process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL + user.media_object.file_path : 
            undefined
        )
    }
/>
```

### Benefits:

- ✅ **Consistency**: Follows same patterns as `UploadMedia` component
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Uses shared code instead of duplicated logic
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Leverages existing TypeScript types
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Benefits from shared toast notifications
- ✅ **Performance**: Uses shared React Query cache invalidation

### Integration:

The component still works with the existing ProfileForm integration:

```tsx
<ProfileImageUpload 
    user={user} 
    onImageUpdate={(imageId) => {
        form.setValue("profile_image_id", imageId);
    }}
/>
```

### File Structure (After Cleanup):
```
apps/web/app/featured/profile/
├── components/
│   ├── ProfileImageUpload/     # Updated component
│   ├── FileUpload/            # Generic component (kept for reference)
│   └── ProfileForm/           # Integration point
└── hooks/
    └── use-profile.hooks.ts   # Profile-specific hooks only

# Shared system (used by ProfileImageUpload):
apps/web/app/shared/
├── hooks/
│   └── use-media-upload.ts    # useMediaUpload, getMediaId, etc.
└── clients/
    └── media.client.ts        # MediaClient
```

The ProfileImageUpload component now seamlessly integrates with your established media upload architecture!
